name: api-routes test db/schema mock
description: Why engine-touching route tests (/tick, /transmit) break, and how the hand-rolled db/schema vitest mock must be kept in sync.
---

`artifacts/api-server/src/routes/api-routes.test.ts` builds a fake `@workspace/db` + `@workspace/db/schema` from a `TABLE_NAMES` whitelist of `{ __table }` proxy objects, plus a fake query/insert builder. It does NOT auto-mirror the real schema barrel.

The rule: anything the engine path imports from the schema barrel must be present in this mock, or the route under test throws during setup and the failure is swallowed into a generic 500/503 — so the assertion failure looks unrelated to the missing mock.

**Why:** the engine tick (controls-store → loadControls) imports the non-table constant `HUB_CONTROLS_ID` from the schema; when the mock lacked it, loadControls threw and `/tick` returned 500, `/transmit` 503 — with no obvious link to the real cause, costing real debugging time.

**How to apply:** when you add a table, a non-table export, or a new drizzle builder method used on the engine path, update this mock: new tables → add to `TABLE_NAMES`; non-table constants (e.g. `HUB_CONTROLS_ID`) → set directly on the `schema` object; new builder methods (e.g. `onConflictDoNothing`) → add to the fake insert/query builder. Also keep the engram fixture's columns in sync with required engram fields (mode, humanContactEnabled, simulationEnabled, …).
