# ENGRAM — PYRI AI Persona Framework

ENGRAM is a full-stack dashboard for **PYRI**, an AI companion built on a fictional
cognitive architecture: layered memory, a belief registry, personas, a symbolic
Hiero-Code language, an emotive micro-expression layer, autonomous engrams, bounded
simulations, media perception, and a multi-mode streaming chat.

It runs four ways:

- **Desktop app (clickable installer)** — a native, self-contained build
  (`.AppImage`/`.deb` on Linux, `.dmg` on macOS, `.exe` on Windows) that bundles
  the dashboard, the API, **an embedded database (no PostgreSQL to install)**, and
  the schema/seed data. Double-click to run; works fully offline against a local
  model, or switch to an online/cloud model from the in-app settings.
- **Fully local / offline (from source)** — one command builds and runs the whole
  app (dashboard + API) on a single port, backed by a local PostgreSQL database and
  a local language model. After the one-time install, it needs no internet.
- **On Replit** — the API and the dashboard run as separate workflows/artifacts
  (unchanged by the packaging below; the desktop build is additive).
- **Mobile app (Android APK)** — an installable APK built from `artifacts/engram-mobile`
  with localized UI, persisted local state for offline continuity, and live online API mode.

---

## Desktop app (installable)

The `artifacts/desktop` package wraps the dashboard + API in [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org)
and produces native installers. The desktop build needs **no PostgreSQL and no
separate setup** — it embeds [PGlite](https://pglite.dev) (Postgres compiled to
WebAssembly), creates its database under the OS user-data directory on first launch,
runs migrations, and seeds reference data automatically.

**Offline vs. online model.** The app opens a Settings window where you choose:

- **Offline** — point at a local OpenAI-compatible runtime (Ollama, LM Studio,
  llama.cpp, vLLM). No outbound network beyond your machine.
- **Online** — provide a cloud base URL + API key. The key is encrypted with the
  OS keychain via Electron `safeStorage` and only ever decrypted in-process. If no
  keychain is available, the key is kept in memory for the current session only and
  **never written to disk in plaintext** (you re-enter it next launch).

### Build the installer for your OS

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen   # generate API client + Zod
pnpm run typecheck:libs                          # build shared libraries
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run build     # bundle the API
PORT=5000 BASE_PATH=/ pnpm --filter @workspace/engram run build   # build the dashboard
pnpm --filter @workspace/desktop run build        # bundle Electron main + stage resources

# then package for the current OS:
pnpm --filter @workspace/desktop exec electron-builder --linux   # or --mac / --win
```

Installers are written to `artifacts/desktop/release/`. **electron-builder must run
on the target OS** (you cannot build a signed `.dmg` on Linux), so cross-OS builds
go through CI — see [Building for all platforms (CI)](#building-for-all-platforms-ci).

> **Note:** the **video** media modality still needs `ffmpeg` + `ffprobe` on `PATH`
> at runtime; all other features (including text/image/audio perception) are
> self-contained in the installer.

### Building for all platforms (CI)

`.github/workflows/desktop-build.yml` builds the installers on a matrix of
`ubuntu-latest` (AppImage + deb), `macos-latest` (dmg), and `windows-latest` (exe),
then uploads them as workflow artifacts. It runs on a `v*` tag push or manually
(`workflow_dispatch`).

Code signing and notarization are **optional** — set these repository secrets and
electron-builder picks them up automatically; with none set, each OS still produces
a working unsigned installer:

| Secret | Platform | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CSC_LINK`, `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` | macOS | Developer ID Application certificate (base64 `.p12`) + password. |
| `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | macOS | Apple notarization credentials. |
| `WIN_CSC_LINK`, `WIN_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` | Windows | Authenticode signing certificate (base64 `.pfx`) + password. |

**macOS needs both signing _and_ notarization.** Gatekeeper on current macOS shows
the "unidentified developer" / "Apple could not verify this app" warning for any app
that is signed but *not* notarized, so the two `CSC_*` secrets and the three `APPLE_*`
secrets must be set together. The build runs with the hardened runtime enabled and
the entitlements in `artifacts/desktop/build/entitlements.mac.plist` (required for
notarization). If only `CSC_*` is set, electron-builder signs but skips notarization
and the installer will still warn; if neither is set the app is left unsigned.

> To obtain credentials: enroll in the [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com)
> ($99/yr) for the Developer ID certificate and an app-specific password, and buy an
> OV/EV Authenticode certificate from a CA (e.g. DigiCert, Sectigo) for Windows.
> Export each certificate to a password-protected `.p12`/`.pfx`, then `base64`-encode
> it into the matching `*_CSC_LINK` secret.

**Windows SmartScreen reputation.** A valid Authenticode signature removes the
"unknown publisher" prompt. A brand-new **OV** certificate still has no SmartScreen
reputation, so the blue "Windows protected your PC" screen can appear until enough
installs accrue; an **EV** certificate earns reputation immediately. Signatures are
SHA-256 and RFC-3161 timestamped so they stay valid after the certificate expires.

## Mobile app (Android APK)

The mobile app is in `artifacts/engram-mobile` (Expo/React Native). It ships:

- **Localized UI** via `@workspace/localization` + persisted locale selection.
- **Offline continuity** for local app state (selected persona + conversation mapping).
- **Online mode** against the deployed API via `EXPO_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`.

### Build a release APK

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen
pnpm run typecheck:libs
pnpm --filter @workspace/engram-mobile exec expo prebuild --platform android --no-install --clean
cd artifacts/engram-mobile/android
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease --no-daemon --stacktrace
```

APK output:

`artifacts/engram-mobile/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

### Build in CI and publish with desktop installers

`.github/workflows/desktop-build.yml` includes an `android` job that builds
`ENGRAM-Mobile-<version>.apk`, uploads it as a workflow artifact, and on `v*`
tag builds also attaches it to the same GitHub Release as the desktop installers.

---

## Run fully local (one command)

> The first run performs one-time setup automatically: it checks prerequisites,
> creates `.env`, installs dependencies, creates the database schema, and seeds
> reference data. Subsequent runs just build and start.

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
./scripts/local/start.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
.\scripts\local\start.ps1
```

Windows users can also double-click `scripts\local\start.bat`.

Then open **http://localhost:5000**. The API serves the dashboard and the
`/api` endpoints on the same port, so there is nothing else to start.

To run the one-time setup by itself (without launching), use the matching
`setup.sh` / `setup.ps1` (or `setup.bat`).

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 24** and **pnpm** (`npm install -g pnpm`).
- A local **PostgreSQL** database. Create one first, e.g. `createdb engram`.
- For offline language features, a local **OpenAI-compatible model runtime**:
  - [Ollama](https://ollama.com) — `http://localhost:11434/v1`
  - [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) — `http://localhost:1234/v1`
  - or any `llama.cpp` / vLLM server exposing the OpenAI API.
- **Optional:** `ffmpeg` + `ffprobe` on your `PATH` — only needed for the **video**
  media modality. Text, image, and audio perception work without them.

> The initial `pnpm install` and the model download need internet **once**. After
> that, the app runs with no outbound network: fonts are self-hosted, the frontend
> talks to the local API, and the API talks to your local model.

---

## Configuration (`.env`)

Setup copies `.env.example` to `.env` on first run. Edit `.env` to match your
machine:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | **Required.** Local PostgreSQL connection string. |
| `PORT` | Port the unified local server listens on (default `5000`). |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | OpenAI-compatible endpoint — point it at your local model. |
| `LLM_MODEL` | Model name your local server hosts (e.g. `llama3.1`). |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | Any non-empty value for local servers. |
| `LLM_VISION_MODEL` | *Optional.* Vision model for image/video (defaults to `LLM_MODEL`). |
| `LLM_TRANSCRIBE_MODEL` | *Optional.* Speech-to-text model for audio/video. |

`WEB_DIST` (the path to the built dashboard) is set automatically by the start
scripts — you don't need to configure it.

### Pointing at a local model

```bash
# Example: Ollama
ollama pull llama3.1
# In .env:
LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
LLM_MODEL=llama3.1
LLM_API_KEY=local
```

With this set, both interactive chat and autonomous transmissions run entirely
against the local model — no code changes required.

---

## What works offline

| Feature | Needs a model? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dashboard, Hub, Memory, Beliefs, Analytics, etc. | No | Read/write the local DB. |
| Simulations & Commons | No (engine) / Yes (generated steps) | The engine runs locally; step text needs the model. |
| Chat & autonomous transmissions | Yes | Need a local chat model running. |
| Image / video understanding | Yes (vision) | Needs a vision-capable model (`LLM_VISION_MODEL`). |
| Audio / video transcription | Yes (speech-to-text) | Needs a transcription model (`LLM_TRANSCRIBE_MODEL`). |
| **Video** media perception | Yes | Also needs `ffmpeg` + `ffprobe` on `PATH`. |

If the model server isn't running, the dashboard still loads and the database
features work; only the language/perception features error until the model is up.

---

## Development mode (separate servers, live reload)

For working on the code with hot reload, run the two dev servers instead of the
bundled single-port build:

```bash
pnpm install
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/engram
pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push
pnpm --filter @workspace/scripts run seed:expressions
pnpm --filter @workspace/scripts run seed:engrams
pnpm --filter @workspace/scripts run seed:hub
# then, in two terminals:
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev
pnpm --filter @workspace/engram run dev
```

---

## Project structure

```
artifacts/engram        # React + Vite dashboard (the UI)
artifacts/api-server    # Express API + autonomy/media engines (serves the UI in local mode)
artifacts/engram-mobile # Expo mobile app
artifacts/desktop       # Electron wrapper → native installers (embeds API + UI + PGlite DB)
lib/api-spec            # OpenAPI source of truth
lib/api-zod             # generated Zod schemas
lib/api-client-react    # generated React Query hooks
lib/db                  # Drizzle schema + client
scripts                 # seed + utility scripts, doc generator
scripts/local           # cross-platform setup/start scripts (this offline package)
docs                    # generated PDFs (proposal, developer guide, readme, user manual)
```

## Common commands

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Run fully local | `./scripts/local/start.sh` (Windows: `.\scripts\local\start.ps1`) |
| Build the desktop app (current OS) | `pnpm --filter @workspace/desktop run build` then `pnpm --filter @workspace/desktop exec electron-builder --linux` (or `--mac` / `--win`) |
| Build Android APK | `pnpm --filter @workspace/engram-mobile exec expo prebuild --platform android --no-install --clean` then `cd artifacts/engram-mobile/android && ./gradlew :app:assembleRelease` |
| Typecheck | `pnpm run typecheck` |
| Build everything | `pnpm run build` |
| Regenerate API artifacts | `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` |
| Push DB schema | `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` |
| Seed reference data | `pnpm --filter @workspace/scripts run seed:expressions` / `seed:engrams` / `seed:hub` |
| Regenerate docs (PDFs) | `node scripts/gen/generate-docs.mjs` |

## Troubleshooting

- **Server won't start, "No language-model endpoint configured."** Set
  `LLM_BASE_URL` in `.env` (e.g. the Ollama URL above).
- **`db push` fails.** Make sure PostgreSQL is running and `DATABASE_URL` is
  correct, and that the database exists (`createdb engram`).
- **Dashboard loads but chat errors.** Your local model server isn't running or
  `LLM_MODEL` isn't a model it hosts.
- **Video media jobs fail.** Install `ffmpeg` + `ffprobe`; other modalities are
  unaffected.
- **Empty pages after a fresh DB.** Run the seed scripts (the start script does
  this on first run).
